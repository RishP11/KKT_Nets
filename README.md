- In this paper we explore the possibility of solving Convex Optimization problems by using Deep Learning to try and possibly learn the optimal variables, Lagrange multipliers and dual variables.

- Why Deep Learning?
    - They have been shown to be Universal Function Approximators.
    
- What are we trying to achieve?
    - We try and see if they can be used to find $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions or even better, the actual optimal points. 
    - Doing so may provide us a better starting point when trying to solve a optimization problem using iterative methods. 
    - Can we learn more ${\color{blue}{organic}}$ solutions?
    - A dive into visualization of the optimization problem.
    - Anything else?

- What did we find?
