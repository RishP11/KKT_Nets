__KKTNets__: A Deep Learning Approach to Convex Optimization via Lagrange Duality

- In this paper we explore the possibility of solving Convex Optimization problems by using Deep Learning to try and possibly learn the optimal variables, Lagrange multipliers and dual variables.

- Why Deep Learning?
    - They have been shown to be Universal Function Approximators.
    - We try and see if they can be used to find atleast $\epsilon$-suboptimal solutions.
